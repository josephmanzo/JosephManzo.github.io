        <h3>About the Band</h3>

            <p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band that was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California by drummer Lars Ulrich, vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Dave Mustain, and bassist Ron McGovney. The group's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship have solidified them as one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, along with lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo.      
            </p>
       
            <p>Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.
